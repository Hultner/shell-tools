# TODO Finder
# Author: Alexander Hultn√©r 2017-11-17
#
# Looks through the repository for TODOs, lists them along side information 
# about when, in what commit and by who they were added so one can ask them
# for clarifications if needed.
#
# Usage:
# ./todo.sh

# Future improvements:
# Other comment block style, i.e. """, --, //, /*, /**, =, ', (*, %, %{, --[[,
# C, !*, <!--, 
# As well as other comment tags i.e. BUG, FIXME, HACK, UNDONE, XXX, TODO
# Shell script for protability.

git grep -l TODO ':(exclude)todo.sh' \
